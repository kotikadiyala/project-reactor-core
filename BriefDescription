Brief Description

1) Why Project Reactor is used

A) Basically as per my understanding java itself, does not support non-blocking asynchronus programming.
   We have to use Future / CompletableFuture, but still they are not non-blocking.
   We have to block them for retrieving the result.

   Hence we need to go far Reactive Streams.

   Reactive Streams are non blocking where as java streams are blocking
   Reactive programming is declarative where as java programming is imperative

   And therefore, in real time operations where data is emited in very large quantities, if blocking streams are used,
   the performance of the application / project would not be ideal. Hence we need to go for Reactive Streams for
   robust and speedy performance.

2) What are the main reactive streams

A) Flux and Mono are 2 Reactive Streams.

   Flux emits 0 to N elements asynchronously where as Mono emits 0 to 1 elements asynchronously .

 3) Where reference documentation and git examples are provided for Project Reactor ?
